        <p>I am a married father of 1 who enjoys spending time with my family, learning to code, and playing basketball!  My last 5        years have been spent in various      IT positions and most recently as     a Team Lead for the Technology        Change Management group at Capital     One.
        </p>
        <p>At this time I am transitioning my acquired skills into a web developer role. With self-study along with training from Codeup,      my plan is to seque into this
            exciting new career path soon!
        </p>
        <p>My hunger for knowledge, problem solving ability, positive attitude, and documented ability to work well
            in diverse teams are assets that I will bring to bear for my new employer.
        </p>
