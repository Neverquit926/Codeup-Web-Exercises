    <p>I am a married father of 1 who enjoys spending time with my family, learning to code, and playing basketball! My
        last 5 years have been spent in various IT positions and most recently as a Team Lead for the Technology Change
        Management group at Capital One. At this time I am transitioning my acquired skills into a web developer role.
        With self-study along with training from Codeup, my plan is to seque into this exciting new career path soon! My
        hunger for knowledge, problem solving ability, positive attitude, and documented ability to work well in diverse
        teams are assets that I will bring to bear for my new employer.
